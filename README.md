# Pathfinding-Algorithms
Create your own maze or generate a pre-made one using the randomObstacles button. Then watch a breadth and depth first traversal of your drawing to find the shortest path!

### Development
This application was developed using vanilla JavaScript with HTML and CSS as the frontend. The IDE I used was Visual Studio Code with Live Server to make testing seemless.
